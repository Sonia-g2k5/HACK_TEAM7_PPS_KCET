 Movie Trailer Like/Dislike Predictor
This mini ML project predicts whether a user will like or dislike a movie trailer based on their feedback. Using logistic regression, we analyze features like genre preference, interest level, actor/director familiarity, and trailer duration. Data is collected through a Google Form, preprocessed, and used to train a simple classification model. The trained model is then used to make predictions on new inputs — a fun and practical ML application in the entertainment domain!

 Libraries Used:

pandas – for data handling

numpy – for numerical operations

scikit-learn – for machine learning (Logistic Regression)
